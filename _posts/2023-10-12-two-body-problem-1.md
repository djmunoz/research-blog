Using Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation and Newton's 3rd Law of Motion, we know that, the mutual
gravitational interaction between two bodies can be expressed as the two following equations of motion (EoM):

\begin{align}
  \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_1 = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{r}_1|^3}(\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{r}_1)~,\;\;\text{and}
  \;\;\;
  \ddot{\mathbf{r}}_2 = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{r}_1|^3}(\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{r}_1)
\end{align}


\begin{align}
  V_{cube} = l w h \label{eq:test2}
\end{align}
