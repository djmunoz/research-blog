Knowing how non-Keplerian forces affect the eccentricity and angular momentum vectors, let us study the dynamical consequences of a real life effect.


1. Compute the dynamical effects that the external force

\begin{align}
{\bf f}_{\rm ext}
=\frac{GM}{r^3}{\bf r}
\left(\frac{4GM}{r}-\dot{\bf r}\cdot\dot{\bf r}\right)
+\frac{4GM}{r^2}\dot{r}\dot{\bf r}
\end{align}

has on $${\bf h}$$ and $${\bf e}$$.

2. Assume that $${\bf r}$$ is *instantaneously* a Keplerian orbit at all times and that the orientation of the orbit is given by the orientation vectors $$\hat{\bf u}={\bf e}/e$$, $$\hat{\bf n}={\bf h}/h$$ and $$\hat{\bf v}={\bf n}\times\hat{\bf u}$$. Then use the conic section solution

\begin{align}
{\bf r} = r(\cos f \hat{\bf u} + \sin f \hat{\bf v});\;\;\;
\text{with}\;\;\;
r=\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos f}
\end{align}

to write $$\dot{\bf h}$$ and  $$\dot{\bf e}$$ explicitly in terms of the true anomaly $$f$$
