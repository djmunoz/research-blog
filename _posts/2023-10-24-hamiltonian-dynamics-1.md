Hamiltonian dynamics is introduced as an advanced topic at the undergrad level or an introductory topic at the graduate level.

In the example given the Hamiltonian is the sum of a kinetic energy, $$p/2m$$, and a potential energy $$V(q)$$, but there are many systems ni which the Hamiltonian does not have this form.
