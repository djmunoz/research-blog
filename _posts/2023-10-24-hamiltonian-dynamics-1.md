Hamiltonian dynamics is introduced as an advanced topic at the undergrad level or an introductory topic at the graduate level.

In the example given the Hamiltonian is the sum of a kinetic energy, $$p/2m$$, and a potential energy $$V(q)$$, but there are many systems ni which the Hamiltonian does not have this form.


### Conservative One-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian Systems

1. Show that if $$H=H(q,p)$$ and that the pair $$(q,p)$$ obeys Hamilton's equations of motion, then

\begin{align}
\frac{d H}{dt}=0
\end{align}

### Example: The linear oscillator

For the equations of motion to be linear the potential $$V(q)$$ must be at most quadratic.
