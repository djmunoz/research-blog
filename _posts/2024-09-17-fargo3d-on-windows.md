I generally do not encourage students to get a Windows machine for professional/research use. But the reality is that many undergraduates already own computers that run Windows, and it is thus more convenient to make do with what we have at hand. An example of this is when we want to run small hydrodynamical simulations on a Windows laptop, which coud already be equipped with powerful specs if it was designed for, say, gaming.

I have asked NAU undergraduate Noah Gordon to look into installing the state-of-the-art hydro code [FARGO3D](https://fargo3d.bitbucket.io/index.html#)
